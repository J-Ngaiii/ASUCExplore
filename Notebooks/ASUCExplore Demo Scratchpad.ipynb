      "   1. Senator Megan Yao\n",
      "   2. Andy Liu, ASUC Senator-Elect: They talk about how the name of the East Asian night market was changed to be more inclusive. EAU is the organizer of the Asian Night Market and never claimed to represent all cultures. To foster representation, they changed the name of the night market. They feel that EAU has not created any representation harm by changing the name. EAU should not be retaliated. \n",
      "   3. Annabel, UC Berkeley Student: As an east asian student, they have found the night market to be a platform to represent their culture and share it with others. It is also a space to connect with UC Berkeleys diverse community. They urge everyone to disregard comments \n",
      "   4. Legistlative director in Senator Pengâ€™s office: As an international student, they miss their home and culture. The EAU night market provides a sense of belonging. When people from all countries come together, their is no tension or politics, it just represents east asian culture. Using terms such as south asian etc., it is important as cultural diversity is respected. She believes that the EAU night market is an important event and the cultural diversity can be respected. \n",
      "   5. Caroline, EAU member: EAU is a small club that aims to separate diversity of the asian community. Their goal is to present the east asian voice. They collaborate with various diverse clubs to represent their cultures. \n",
      "   6. Tikashi Shu, Cal Japan Club: Identifies as east and south east asian. He believes that EU night market provides a space to celebrate their culture. This is an event that he believes many students look forward to. Without the night market, Berkeley with lose its identity of a diverse institution. \n",
      "   7. Vivian, EAU member: They are not finance professionals, they did not know there was various financial support available and they were hit hard during the pandemic. By looking at bylaws, they realised that the are not complying with a particular bylaw. They are working towards fixing it with the CFO and ficomm. They ask everyone to respect the work they do and keep an open mind as they commit to be a more transparent organization. \n",
      "   8. Ellen, Director of Community relations, ASUC Senator Peng: the EAU night market provided them with a sense of belonging, as an east asian international student, it provides a platform to find a sense of pride and comfort and find a safe space to feel included. They urge everyone to reconsider the situation about rebranding of EAU.\n",
      "   9. President of Taiwanese Student Association: Working with EAU, their organization has become more financially stable amd also allowed them to communicate with members of the Berkeley community which was not possible before. Working with EAU ahs been a pleasant experience for them and they hope that this night market continues. They appreciate EAUâ€™s efforts to promote diversity. \n",
      "   10. Clairice, Events chair, EAU: inclusivity is an essential part of the EAU and everyone is welcome. Inclusive clubs promote diversity, fosters relationships etc. which is available at EAU. They give priority to vendors who have not participated. They also choose their vendors based on slack participation. The name of the night market was changed to be inclusive for all asian clubs combined. \n",
      "   11. Rachel, EAU member: Reading a letter of behalf of the president of Burmese Student Associatrion. They have participated in teh EAU before being a student. They receive a lot of support from EAU members, they appreciate EAUâ€™s rebranding to be inclusive to asian vendors from diff. Parts of Asia. It provides an opportunity to share their culture with UC Berkeley community. They have a tax policy which is neccessary for the night market functioning and they did not have any issues with it. \n",
      "   12. Daren lee, Indonesian student Associaiton: They are representing over 350 ethnic groups from Indonesia. EAU has given them a voice to represent their culture. EAU has given the Berkeley Indonesian Association an avenue to represent their org through food. Thye want to note that EAU night market has been instrumental in uniting ethnic groups and many mebmbers the power to be proud of their heritage. Many members of their club found the club due to EAU and thus the impact on the org has been large. \n",
      "   13. Nam, VP of events, Thai Student Association: Hello! Iâ€™m Nam, VP of Events from the Thai Student Association (ThaiSA). Iâ€™m so sorry for the inconvenience. The reason Iâ€™m typing my response is because Iâ€™m in class and I hope that shows how much support I have for this club. Ever since joining ThaiSA my freshman year, EAU night has definitely been one of my core memories with the club whether that is attending the night market or selling Thai tea for ThaiSA. The night market has always been an event that everyone looks forward to. Weâ€™ve already gotten many questions as to whether there will be a night market this semester because people really want to come enjoy the event. Working as an officer in ThaiSA, Iâ€™ve been in constant communication with the EAU officers. All of them have been extremely inclusive and accommodating to any issues we may have. ThaiSA itself has been part of the night market for many years and we would love to continue doing so.\n",
      "   14. Senator Wong response: They agree with many points made today. Their goal was not to punish or demonize EAU but to work with the club to identify weaknesses. They also provided funds from their discretionary funds to support the night market. The central issue was not inclusivity, it is that EAU is in violation of ASUC bylaws. They want to conduct an audit of the finances of the club, they should not ask for $13,000 and then clubs should not be taxed. They should not be taxed for renting tables that the ASUC is funding. They are not sweeping potential tax evasion under the club. The Asian Night Market is a platform for many other clubs and they want to urge the committee to hold off on any investigations until the night market in April. They have photo evidence and they will bring witnesses during closed session. They will never put anyoneâ€™s safety and comfortability on the line. They urge everyone to attack the issue and not the person and respect peopleâ€™s confidentiality. They want to move forward in a productive manner and work with EAU leaders towards a solution. \n",
      "   15. Senator Peng Response: They believe is that the core issue is that the tax and funding issue is being mixed with culture issue. There were many clubs and leaders supporting EAU and their night market. In terms of funding issues and bylaw violations, that can be discussed separately. They have a problem with holding a club hostage due to branding issues. They look forward to the closed sessions and coming to a common ground between both parties. \n",
      "   16. Senator Vasquez response: They want to share their approach towards this topic. It is important that this committee addresses the bylaws and considering if EAU financial situation is enough and if drastic measures need ot be taken. They agree with Senator Peng, but they also encourage everyone to first look at what the bylaws say.\n",
